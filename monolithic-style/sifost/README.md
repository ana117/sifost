# Introduction
Information is an integral part of life for any kind of purpose. It is a pure nature of humanity to gather as much information as possible to know as much as possible about their surrouding. With sufficient amount of relevant information, humanity can create and improve many amazing things to increase their quality of life.

Form is one of popular way to gather informations. It is the quickest and the cheapest way to mass gather information. It is done by giving respondents a list of questions and analyze all answers for a meaning conclusion. It is popular amongst researchers who want to gather data from the group they're researching on or services who want to gather feedback from their costumers. However, one downside of form is the difficulty of distributing and gathering many forms to and from multiple respondent.

SIFOST is created in hope to simplify the process of making forms by facilitating its creation, distribution, and search for the perfect respondent. SIFOST will accommodate form creation by providing templates and distributing it to any kind of respondent (registered or not). The end result of each forms can be displayed in raw data or with graph and be published by the form maker to the public's eyes. The results can also be archived for future usage.

For the respondent, they have the option to either follow the link the form maker gives to them or choose many categories that fit to their personality on the main form catalogue. The main page will display navigation feature for the user as well as some important information such as news from the developers and currently popular forms. The catalogue will contain active forms that can be accessed by anyone, regardless if they have registered or not unless if a form is set to only allow registered users. Any registered respodent can access restricted forms and can choose what categories of form they like the most. Users will receieve notification if a new form with preferred categories is created.

SIFOST is the perfect tool for info-gatherer and info-givers to help each other on gathering important information for research and feedback and for info-giver's voice to be heard.
